# Apple Store | Fully Functional E-commerce

![banner](banner.png)

> Construction of an e-commerce taught in the `ILW Yennefer` channel where we use Redux to manage the global state of the application as the product basket in which Reducers was used to add and remove items from the shopping basket. The CMS `Sanity.io` was used to manage the products that are available for sale on the site, such as storing all necessary product information in their respective fields. Finally, we use the `Stripe API` as a Payments Infrastructure, where we can accept payments, send payments and manage our online business.
